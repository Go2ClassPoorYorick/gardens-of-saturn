Due to Saturn's unique environment, most biological creatures are incapable of travel outside the blessing of an [[Eidolons -The Elementals|Eidolon]] without quickly succumbing to [[Alchemagical Sickness]]. The traditional avian urge to migrate has effectively ceased to exist, with most animals unlikely to brave the distance between even two closely passing Eidolons. 

Despite this, the homing instincts of a  particular breed of bird known as "Homing Doves" seems to have survived, and through a system of triangulation and communication with other islands, a semi-reliable method of predicting the current path and travel of particular Islands has been developed.
