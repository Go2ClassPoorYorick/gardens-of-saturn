Due to Saturn's [[Alchemagic|Alchemagical]] composition, global populations of natural wildlife are all but extinct. While local populations of rats, mites, [[Birds]], and the occasional aggressive wildlife riddled island may exist, discovery of new biological life forms is a generally rare and celebrated experience for scholarly and particularly religious communities alike.


The primary non-humanoid creatures on Saturn are elementals such as [[Sky Fish]] or [[Fire Sprites]]
