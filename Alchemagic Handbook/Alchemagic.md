The elemental composition and nature of Saturn has resulted in a greatly reduced the difficulty and complexity of the arcane arts for Saturn's population, with individuals incapable of magic manipulation being a slight minority within typical Satersian communities.

Referring to the accepted [[Elemental Chart]] (WIP, to be adjusted), it becomes clear that the Satersian inclination of magic is strongly related to it's "natural" environment of air, fire, and it's conceptual alignment with chaos. 

The natural aptitude for magic in the world's population, in addition to a lack of ore/manufactured resources has resulted in a general decrease in understanding of theory and instrumentation outside of specialized communities with access to powerful, but ancient and aging materials and constructs. While many a powerful sorcerer may exist, wizards, arcanists, and practiced theorymen are very few.

Likewise, natural druidic or religious magics relating to water, earth, and elements traditionally aligned with the concept of order are perhaps the rarest types of all, with the most studied scholars in modern Satersian study and travel knowing less than a handful of living religious sects, and few knowing any druids at all. To many, casters capable of communing with wildlife, growing fauna, or manipulating water into existence are mythical. 

In correlation to this unprecedented sensitivity to magic, a mysterious new illness has been tracked spreading across Eidolonic Cities.
